Over 80% of teens love shopping online but 67% of them are forced to use cash and 52% use parents cards/ payment apps.

FamPay is solving this problem by helping teens make payments online/offline independently under their parents supervision, without the need of a bank account. As part of our mission, we are raising a new, financially aware generation of Indians who understand the fundamentals of personal finance and are capable of making decisions in their best long term interest."
